Title: Presentation Schedule
Posted on: Monday, May 17, 2021 2:46:30 PM CST
Pay attention to your group time slot, for both presenter group and grader group. Each group would help to evaluate another group's presentation, make sure your group be ready for both.  
And come a bit early than your slot (maybe about 10 mins). Absence or late may get punishment since we value both your time and the staffs'.

Title: CA2 Ex.4
Posted on: Friday, May 14, 2021 8:11:48 AM CST
It looks like Ex.4 in CA2 causes lots of problems, mainly problems to understand what to do. As the end of the semester is near, we cannot shift the deadline. So we take Ex.4 out of CA2. If you have already done this Exercise, we may give you some bonus for it. For now we stop the discussion of CA2.

Title: Midterm 2
Posted on: Monday, April 19, 2021 10:26:29 AM CST
The second midterm is scheduled for April 27, 20:00-22:00 in LTW 102 and LTE 102. The room arrangement is as follows:
LTW 102: groups 1-18
LTE 102: groups 19-31
Despite some requests there will be no sample available. There was no MT2 last year. In addition, to avoid another disaster we will implement a few changes:
1) There will be fewer programming tasks. The additional time needed for dealing even with simple problems in C++ is far too high and risky.
2) Instead, we will have questions that ask you to apply the basic algorithms taught in the course on specific examples.
3) The midterm is to cover the sections 6, 8 and 9 (until April 23) with a strong focus on Sections 8 and 9. B- and B+-trees will not be covered.

Title: B+ Tree (Definition and Confusion)
Posted on: Monday, April 19, 2021 10:14:07 AM CST
There have been some confusing posts concerning the notion of B+-tree. There are indeed different definitions in the literature. In the lectures we used the definition commonly employed in the context of databases, the most prominent and decisive application case for B+-trees. According to this definition not all keys appear in the tree nodes, and pointers from leave do not point to the stored record with the given key, but to blocks. The reason for adopting such a definition is that otherwise there would be a lot or reorganisation effort needed in the B+-tree.
The are definitions in the literature, where the real data records are de facto ignored, and all keys appear in the leaves. This is just a simplification, which could be used, when the data is not kept in secondary storage.
Unfortunately, no full implementation in C++ is available for the advanced notion of B+-tree; CS225 last year provided a Python implementation. You may simplify your handling of B+-trees by adopting one of the available simplified implementations, i.e. you may dispense with secondary storage issues.

Title: Lab 9 and Programming Assignment 2
Posted on: Saturday, April 10, 2021 1:28:38 PM CST
Lab 9 deals with B-trees and B+trees and even their combined use. It turns out to be impossible to provide a fresh implementation in time; this is just too complex. Instead use a C++ implementation from github---there are several available.
Do the same for Programming Assignment 2, but indicate where you got the code. Integrating the github code with your code from Programming Assignment 1 and extending it with some non-trivial queries is difficult enough.

Title: Assignment 6, Ex. 3
Posted on: Wednesday, March 24, 2021 12:27:17 PM CST
As the recursive implementation of insert and delete has already been provided, the exercise has been modified. You only need to sketch the iterative implementations and discuss the differences. No coding is required. This should also compensate for the hassle with Assignment 5.
Nonetheless, you are still encouraged to explore iterative versions of the insert, find and delete operations on AVL trees, but they they are not part of the assignment.

Title: Assignment 5, Ex. 1
Posted on: Saturday, March 20, 2021 6:55:04 PM CST
There seems to be a big misunderstanding here. This exercise was meant to be conceptual: describe the implementation, but don't implement it in C++.
Fibonacci heaps appear in the programming assignment 1; that suffices.

Title: Midterm 1 -- Note on Cheating (Important)
Posted on: Wednesday, March 17, 2021 8:32:14 AM CST
The rule was clear: no communication with WeChat or similar means is permitted. Nonetheless, some students violated this rule. Those who did will receive 0 for the midterm.
In addition, cheating students are warned that any further cheating in this course will lead to a grade F. This in in accordance with Item 12 in the syllabus. According to the policy of ZJUI further actions by the institute cannot be excluded.

Title: More on Midterm 1
Posted on: Monday, March 8, 2021 1:58:21 PM CST
Organisation. Concerning the organisation of midterm 1, the conceptual question will be paper-based to avoid the necessity of scanning. Computing questions will need to be uploaded.
You will need your laptop. As power outlets are limited in LTW and LTE please ensure that your laptop is fully charged to survive the two hours exam. Should your battery be already so old that it cannot last for 2 hours, you better bring some long enough power cable.
Scope. Concerning the scope, the exam covers what we have dealt with in the lectures and labs, i.e. sequence data structures and associated algorithms, priority queues and a bit of hashing. You are of course allowed to use the code that has been provided in the labs, as we do not expect that this can all be re-implemented with only 2 hours.
The provided sample midterm exam script from last year gives you some hints what to expect. Of course, you will be expected to use C++ instead of Python. Further note that last year priority queues were only dealt with later in the lectures, so they did not appear in the first midterm. This year, however, we have not yet handled tries or binary search trees, so questions in this direction are of course not part of the midterm.

Title: Hint for Ass.3, Ex. 4(ii)
Posted on: Sunday, March 7, 2021 12:23:22 PM CST
Due to multiple requests here's a bit more help for this exercise.
Use a divide and conquer approach. That is, when you add k new elements to a heap, add them at the end (equivalently, add them as new tree leaves). The heap is a binary tree, so you actually add k_1 elements to the left subtree of the root and k_2 new elements to the right subtree, with k_1 + k_2 = k. Proceed recursively until you get to trees of height ≤ 2. Whenever you have insert k_1 (k_2) elements into the subtrees, you only need to sift down the root to obtain a heap. Then you can use induction for the proof of the complexity statement. For the induction base you have to explore multiple cases for trees of height ≤ 2, for which you can minimize the number of swap to be just k+1.

Title: More on Midterm 1
Posted on: Wednesday, March 3, 2021 1:39:47 PM CST
As the question came up, both midterm exams will be computer-based comprising a mixture of conceptual and programming exercises. You need to bring your laptop. You need to be able to access BB, as the exam script will become visible on BB right in time for the exam. Upload of answers is done in the same way as for all homework assignments. The exam is open book, so you can also bring all your lecture material, textbooks, etc. For the programming exercises you will be requested to extend or modify existing codes, so make sure that all sample code is available.

Title: Welcome to CS 225
Posted on: Monday, January 4, 2021 11:57:38 AM CST
Dear students,
Welcome to the course CS 225 "Data Structures", which will begin next week on January 11. We will have the first lecture and the first labs both on the first Monday.
All assignments, programming assignments and the final presentations this semester will be group assignments. For this you need to form groups of 3 or 4 students. Please send the names of your group members by email to me, so I can set up the groups in BB and allocate the TAs and lab groups.
If you have problems to find classmates to form a group together with you, you can launch a search for classmates in Piazza or send a message to me, so we can bring you together with other students. Group formation has to be completed before the deadline of the first assignment.
The grouping does not apply to the first lab on January 11, which is dedicated to C++. Please choose one of the lab rooms (B304, B404, B434, B333), but make sure that in every room there are no more than 30 students.
kind regards

Title: Important announcement regarding the final assessments for IE2
Posted on: Saturday, May 16, 2020 12:25:10 PM CST
Dear Students,
This message will give details about the final Listening and Reading exam, final Wiring exam for ZJE students and the final Spoken Presentation assessment. 
After consideration and discussion with the Center for Academic Affairs, it has been decided that the final Listening and Reading exam and the Writing exam for ZJE students will be postponed until all students return to campus in time for the Fall/Autumn semester in September.
The reason for this decision relates to the broader decision by Academic Affairs for all courses to only give exams that can be carried out online. Exams and assessments which cannot be done online will instead be delayed until sometime in September. 
For Integrated English 2 this means that the final Listening & Reading exam and the Writing exam will not take place on May 25th as originally planned.
This has no effect on the final speaking assessment which remains the same.
We understand that this may cause some concern for those students who worry about how this delay will affect their GPA. However, this is something that can be discussed with the Center for Academic Affairs and your institute at a later date.
For now, you just need to know that in your IE2 class, the last major task of this semester is to complete your final presentation and submit it before the deadline on the 22nd of May.
In the summer vacation period, you should dedicate a little time each week to practice for TOEFL or IELTS tests to prepare for the final exams in September.
If you have further questions about the final assessments, please use the QnA forum here on blackboard and we will try to answer you as soon as possible.
  All the best,
Your integrated English Instructors

Title: Welcome to mid-terms!
Posted on: Monday, April 13, 2020 2:25:53 AM CST
In a few hours, the Week 9 content folders will open and it will be ready for your mid-term presentation. The *only* required activity is your midterm presentation in the Speaking/Week 9 folder. This will be your first graded activity in this course.
You are strongly encouraged to go back to previous weeks and review lectures, reading tasks, and the reading task responses of your classmates before recording your video.
If you have questions, first review the Q&A forum to search if your question has already been answered. If not, you can post a new question.
Plan ahead and do not wait until the last minute to submit your presentation. Expect technical difficulties and for the network to be slow. The scores of late submissions will be reduced by 5% per day that it is late.
As always, you are allowed multiple submissions up to the deadline.

Title: Reminder: Homework submissions
Posted on: Wednesday, March 11, 2020 4:31:57 AM CST
Dear students,
After the first few weeks, I have some additional tips and reminders to help the course run more smoothly for all of us.
1) Do the assigned pre-reading and watch the lesson videos before you do your presentation or writing assignment for the week. Your feedback will be given assuming that you've learned from the lesson materials, so to avoid the embarassment and waste of your time, please prepare yourself appropriately. If it's clear that you did not pay attention to weekly lessons, you will not receive credit for that week's work until you do.
2) Submit your homework in the correct place. If it is an assignment for Week 4, it belongs in the assignment submission for week 4 and not week 3. If you want credit for your work, it must be in the right place. Please note, also, that your homework submissions are "SUBMISSIONS" and not "COMMENTS." It is important to pay attention to where you put your work for it to be managed efficiently. See the image below if you are not sure about the differences between these two terms.
2.1) Concerning presentation submissions for all students, starting week 5 with Presentation 2, ALL submissions must be via OneDrive with the link as described in this important announcement from week 3. It takes far too long for us to download videos that are submitted as an attachment. Starting week 5, any uploaded/attached presentations will receive an automatic zero until you submit it correctly  by uploading it to OneDrive and linking it. We appreciate your flexibility and support in this. I understand this will be unfamiliar to some of you. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the education tools your campus provides. I have curated some documentation (in both English and Mandarin) for you to review on a recent Q&A thread. If you need further help with this, please contact IT services for help.
2.2) Concerning writing submissions for ZJE students, feel free to continue attaching Word documents if this works better for you.
3) If you experience any technical difficulties, such as not being able to submit an assignment in the right place, let us know immediately via the WeChat group or email, and wait to submit it in the correct place. Many students are submitting work in other, incorrect, weeks/folders without telling us about the problem. This will result in no participation credit for the missing week's material until it is submitted correctly. For example, homework for Week 4 speaking needs to be submitted in the week 4 speaking assignment. If you put it anywhere else, it will get lost and uncounted.
If you have any questions or concerns, you may email me at william@intl.zju.edu.cn or contact any of us on the WeChat group. The Q&A forum still works, but the other options often receive a faster response.
Thanks, and keep up the consistent work!
Will

Title: Integrated English 2 WeChat Group
Posted on: Monday, February 17, 2020 5:31:15 PM CST
I've opened up a WeChat group for all sections of Integrated English 2 combined. We will continue to use Blackboard as much as possible for submissions, but, this WeChat group will be a more familiar way to connect with us and get support if you have any questions or problems with the course materials or Blackboard.
Join us:
This should largely replace the Q&A forum, but I suspect all of you will be much more comfortable with WeChat.

Title: Submission errors
Posted on: Monday, February 17, 2020 4:40:31 PM CST
Some of you may be experiencing an error ("failure to save message") when you submit discussion forum posts. We urge you to contact ITS to resolve this. However, I can offer a tip to make sure you don't lose your writing when errors like this happen.
Compose your response in another app, like Notepad, first, and then copy it over when you're ready. Many things can happen that might erase the information in a webpage textbox, and not all browsers are designed to save what you type.
Hopefully, ITS can provide a solution soon.
P.S., a couple of things to remember
A) When asking us, or anyone for that matter, for assistance, please provide enough information for us to understand the problem. We are powerful and magical creatures, but alas we cannot yet read minds. That goes for literally every person you need to ask for assistance: ITS, other professors, your bank,  etc.
B) If it is not urgent or personal, use the Q&A forum, please! It's much easier to answer a question once and let all students read the question and response than it is to respond to the same issue hundreds of times.

Title: Welcome to Spring Semester 2020
Posted on: Sunday, February 16, 2020 3:05:35 PM CST
Dear Undergraduate Students,
  Welcome to the new semester and to Integrated English 2. As you know, this semester the university will be running all courses online. I know this adds extra challenges to your studies, but I'm confident that we can make the most of it.
  Integrated English 2 this semester is going to make use of a range of online tools and methods to deliver English teaching content and training tasks. These are designed specifically for you to improve and practice the English skills you need for academic success.
  There are a few important things to know about this online course and several points you should consider about.
How you will interact with the online course
Most of the online course will be delivered via blackboard. There are three main ways you will interact with the course materials:
The speaking course this semester focuses on Presentation skills.
The writing course is about Science report writing.
  Each week you will have a new set of online tasks to complete. These will include a video lecture to watch. These will be around 20 minutes.
You will usually have reading or listening tasks to do; this is similar to last semester but this time you will have to post your answers to tasks on blackboard.
ZJE students will also have extra instruction each week for science writing and will be given a writing practice task each week.
We have discussion forums on Blackboard for you to post your answers to tasks. We can then read your responses and where appropriate offer feedback and advice on your English.
  The discussion forums will be an important point of interaction with your English professors. Through the forum you can ask questions about the course, questions about individual tasks, and you can interact with other students. You can see other students’ work and read feedback from professors. This should help everyone learn things about their English as well as stay in touch with what’s happening with the course.
How you will be assessed
This semester is a very special case and the assessments might have to change as a result.
Speaking: Right now, the plan is to have you complete two speaking assessments online by recording and uploading video recorded spoken presentations. One short talk and one longer presentation with visuals.
Over the course of the semester, you will submit 3 non-graded practice presentations. You must record these as video files to submit on Blackboard. Instructions on how to do this will be provided.
For assessment you will submit 1 graded mid-term recorded presentation, and for your final speaking assessment you will submit a recorded presentation with visual aids (using PowerPoint slides, etc.).
  Listening and Reading: Right now, we anticipate that by the end of the semester, everyone will have returned to campus and be able to sit the final exam as normal. If that is not the case then we will have to find an alternative way to run the final listening and reading exam online. But this has not been decided yet. So, for now do not worry as much about this test.
ZJE Writing: As was the case last semester, ZJE students will also take the extra writing component of Integrated English 2. The situation for the writing exam is the same as for listening and speaking above
Now, throughout the semester it is very important that you pay attention to your emails and blackboard announcements and keep track of the tasks and work you are doing to improve your English. Whenever you are unsure what to do, you can ask using blackboard or by sending an email.
    Head over to the Content section of blackboard and access the week one speaking practice materials to get started.
  All the best for this unusual and interesting new semester.
  Sincerely,
Your English Professors.

Title: Math 286 Grades
Posted on: Monday, June 14, 2021 12:11:53 PM CST
The Math 286 Grades are now online. Please refer to the column "Final Score" for your total numerical score (0-100), from which the final letter grade (the one which counts at the end of the day) is computed according to a scheme similar to last semester's Math 241. (This scheme will be published soon.)
I am sorry that yesterday evening, due to upload errors, some inconsistent data may have been on BB. The column "Total", if anything, contained the wrong data.
The final exam is now rated as 45+7 (full score 45 marks, exactly corresponding to its weight of 45%, and 7 optional marks). Details on this will be published in a revised version of the solutions file. Extra credits are traded in for 5% of the final exam score (whichever relative score is better), and similarly for the homework. The exact spreadsheet formula for the final score is
40*(E/45)+M+MAX(25*E/45,H)+L+MAX(5*E/45,C)
(E final exam, M midterm, H homework, L lab, C extra credit)
Happy Dragon Boat Festival!

Title: Math 286 Course Evaluation
Posted on: Tuesday, June 1, 2021 3:16:16 PM CST
Dear Math 286 students,
please do me a favor and complete the Math286 course evaluation at
https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xSAmKRCuU0Wsz2jsgDJQCOnMVLQF6hhIhjqiVXqkhG1UNExTN1U5OFZXUUNQWUtHWFM1OTgxWVVaUi4u
within 3 days from now, if you haven't done yet. Your feedback is very important for detecting strenghts/weeknesses of this year's course and improving the course next semester. The last two questions are:
Q15: Which topic in the course did you find most/least interesting?
Q16: Where there any prerequisites for the course that you think you didn't have; if ``yes'', which are these?
Many thanks, TH

Title: Information about the Final Examination
Posted on: Friday, May 21, 2021 12:54:29 PM CST
The final examination in Math286 will be held on Fri May 28, 9-12am, in LTW 102, 201, 204. The rules are the same as for the Calculus III final exam last semester; see also Slide 72 of lecture55-46_handout.pdf
Weight: 45% of the total score; 5% can be replaced by extra credits (if the relative extra-credit score is higher)
Topics: All topics covered in Lectures 1-54 (no questions on PDE's). There will be no dedicated questions on LInear Algebra and Complex Numbers, but you may need to use knowledge in these fields when answering questions about ODE's.
Office hours:  Before the exam I will have office hours on Wed May 26, 10:30 - 12:00, in ZJUI 1C-415. Their purpose is to resolve questions (if any) about the course material you have encountered during (or before) the review period, not to answer any examination-specific questions. (Those should be asked on piazza.com.)
Several of our TA's are conducting Math286 review sessions for their discussion group next week - you are very much encouraged to attend. Date/time/venue will be the same as for the TA office hours (see announcement of Jan 16), unless they have informed you otherwise. If the schedule conflicts with other exams, you are free to switch to another TA.
This year's exam will be similar to (but also different from) those in previous years. The two sample final exams I've put in the folder "Exams" certainly serve as good preparatory exercises for a major portion of this year's exam. Solutions will be uploaded on the weekend.
Good luck!

Title: About Lectures 55, 56
Posted on: Friday, May 21, 2021 11:49:12 AM CST
The lecture slides for Lecture 55 and 56 contain 3 important slides at the end, which especially students who didn't attend Lecture 56 should note:
1. Information on the final exam: The rules will be the same as for the Calculus III final exam; see Slide 72.
2. Course evaluation: Please do us a favor and complete the online course evaluation form for Math286 this Spring. Click the link on Slide 73 and note the additional questions Q15, Q16.
3. Call for TA's for my Calculus III course in Fall 2021; see Slide 74.
Since attendance during the last week was low, I have decided not to ask a question about PDE's in the final exam. But be prepared for a question about the material in Lectures 53, 54.

Title: About lab presentations today, 5:00 - 8:20 p.m.
Posted on: Tuesday, May 18, 2021 2:28:01 PM CST
The time limit of 10 min per work group will be enforced strictly today. Please try to make your presentation short, focus only on selected parts from the report (which you can always quote if necessary), and let only 1or 2 work group members do the presentation.
Nevertheless expect the later talks to be delayed by a certain time, since switching between groups takes a few minutes (based on the experience yesterday). Please avoid such delays, if possible, i.e., by having your USB stick ready if it's your turn or uploading the presentation file in advance.

Title: Lab Presentation Schedule
Posted on: Wednesday, May 12, 2021 4:36:48 PM CST
Lab presentations are scheduled for Mon May 17, 4-6 pm and Tue May 18, 5-8 pm, in LTN-B 424.  Time slots are per discussion group as follows:
Group 1 (Niu Yiqun): May 17, 4-5pm
Group 2 (Yu Chengting): May 17, 5-6pm
Group 3 (Yuan Yue): May 18, 5-6pm
Group 4 (Chen Shengjian): May 18, 6-7pm
Group 5 (Qin Tianzuo): May 18, 7-8pm
The TA's will make the actual presentation schedule. Each work group has 10 min presentation time. You need to be present in LTN-B 424 only for the presentation of your work group. Should there be some conflict with another assignment, get in touch with your TA early and ask for rescheduling the presentation. Work groups can select a single presenter or switch presenters during their talk. The presentation score (5 marks) is always per work group, and likewise for the lab report score (10 marks).
Before your presentation you have to hand in the lab report of 6-8 pages (excluding computer printouts). We won't impose the page limit strictly - since it depends on the format -, but obvious breaches of the rule (such as using double-spaced typesetting to reduce the effective length to 2.5 pages, or writing as densely as on the cheating sheet for our final exam in Calculus 3;-) will be penalized.
Be sure to name all group members and their student id's on the first page of the report, and - this represents a new requirement! - please include the following honorary statement on the first page, signed by each group member:
We declare that this report is our own original work, and every work group member has a fair share in this work. For the preparation of the report we have not used any other resources than the Math 286 lecture material and the references cited in the report.
The lab problems and basic suggestions for designing your presentation/report can be found in the file lab.pdf in the Math286 root folder. Here is some further advice: Conceive your presentation for someone who has attended Math286 but has no background in numerical solutions of ODE's. That is, you should explain (in a lucid way) the ideas behind the three methods and the key parameters (order, step size, local/global truncation error, etc.). The remaining time can be used for presenting your solution to one or both of the lab problems (for the presentation one problem is enough) and maybe discuss some related aspects of your choice. For the lab report it is mandatory to solve (or at least attempt to solve) both lab problems. Here you should give full details of your solutions, describe the software used, provide a basic error analysis, etc. On the other hand you can reference anything in Chapter 8 of our textbook in the report and need not explain the numerical methods from scratch.
Best wishes, TH

Title: About Homework 13
Posted on: Friday, May 7, 2021 3:39:04 PM CST
The former exercise H84 in Homework 13 has been replaced by a new (shorter) exercise about the characteristic polynomial of similar matrices. The old exercise, which requires the material on stability of linear systems discussed only in the 2nd half of next week, is now optional (H87).
The latest version of Homework 13 contains notes on H81 and H82 b) at the end, which for their solution require material from next week's lectures. My apologies for this oversight!

Title: Deadline for Homework 11
Posted on: Wednesday, April 28, 2021 2:55:55 PM CST
Because of the heavy workload this week (with midterms on Tue) you can hand in H69 - H72 of Homework 11 together wit Homework 12 on May 6. The TA's will be advised to select for presentation during tomorrow's discussion session only exercises from H66 - H68. Once a solution to an exercise has been presented, however, it is not possible to hand in your own solution to this exercise later.
I hope this eases the situation a bit. The remaining homework (2 assignments) will be made available soon, so that you can better plan the semester finish. To give you more time, lab presentations will be scheduled only in the last week of the semester (on May 17, 18).

Title: Next lecture(s)
Posted on: Tuesday, April 27, 2021 8:21:22 PM CST
In the lectures on Wed April 28 and Fri April 30 we will start discussing 1st-order ODE systems and the significance of eigenvectors/eigenvalues for their solution. These are core topics of Math 286, and hence for students who have recently missed some lectures a good "opportunity" (rather I should say, an obligation) to return to class.

Title: Lecture Slides on LInear Algebra
Posted on: Tuesday, April 27, 2021 8:22:05 PM CST
The slides on Linear Algebra (lecture42-45_handout.pdf) contain much more material than we have actually discussed in the lecture. Students who didn't attend one of these lectures should note the relevant topics:
The only fields of interest for Math286 are Q, R, C.
You are expected to understand the basic Linear Algebra concepts (vector space, linear combination, generating set, linear independence, basis, dimension, subspaces, linear map) in the non-standard setting. Particularly instructive in this regard are the Problem on Slide 27 ff and the example on Slide 32 ff.
You should know the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra, the dimension formula for subspaces, direct sums, the dimension formula for linear maps (including "kernel of a linear map"), coordinate vectors and change-of-basis matrices.

A new version of Homework 11 has been uploaded. This contains a new optional exercise, H75, on the Laplace transform, a correction and an additional hint to H72, and a clarification of the limit in H69 (the real variable s or, more generally, for a complex variable the real part Re(s) should tend to +infinity).

Title: About late HW submissons
Posted on: Thursday, April 15, 2021 11:06:19 AM CST
It has come to my attention that some students are notoriously late with their homework submission. This is against our rules ("late homework will not be accepted") and also conflicts with the timely publication of our sample solutions after the deadline. Hence I have advised our TA's to inforce the HW deadline strictly from now on and impose a penalty of at least 50% of the corresponding score in case of violation.
Thanks for your understanding, TH

The details of the lab project have been fixed and announced. Look for a file "Lab project" in the root folder. TA's will give you more information in today's discussion session, in which also the lab work groups will be formed.
Please note that homework assignments (with somewhat reduced work load) will continue until the end of the semester. So you should manage your time accordingly and start working on the lab project early. Lab work groups can meet anywhere at any time.

Venues:          ECE students: LTE 102/103;         all others: LTW 102/103
Format: Multiple choice, 15 questions, strictly CLOSED BOOK (no electronic devices, no notes, no cheating sheet, etc., only a pen is allowed)
Weight: 15 % of the total score
Topics: All topics discussed so far in the lecture and homework. The last relevant topic is "Euler equations" (discussed today). The rather technical question whether solutions of Euler equations on (0,oo) can be extended to the whole real line (skipped in today's lecture) will not be required.
Good luck!

The knowledge of higher-order linear ODE's with constant coefficients required to solve the exercises of Homework 6 is contained in lecture21-24 and will be completely available only after Lecture 24 on Mon Mar 22. However, I am planning to change the order of the material discussed (examples and the homogeneous case on Wed, inhomogeneous case on Fri, proofs and more background on Mon), so that you can do at least the mandatory exercises (except H39 perhaps) after the lecture on Fri.

Title: Remote Learning
Posted on: Monday, March 1, 2021 3:20:52 PM CST
Dear Students,
a happy and healthy New Lunar Year of the Buffalo to all of you!
I am not quite sure whether all of you are already back on Campus and able to follow the Math 286 Lectures in person. For those who are not yet allowed to come back I have made the lecture videos of last year (back then the course was taught online) available; cf. link in the root folder. Last year's lectures were slightly different, and with different breaks between lectures, but nevertheless they provide a viable alternative route to studying the current material if you can't attend the lecture. Our present topic "uniform convergence" (lecture11-13_handout.pdf, covered in Lectures 11-14 until Wed), was discussed last year in Lectures 10-13 (starting at Minute 16 in Lecture 10 and ending at Minute 32 in Lecture 13). The material at the end of lecture11-13_handout.pdf (new for this year) is optional and can be studied directly from the slides.
If for the same reason you can't submit your homework in person, you should notify your TA well in advance of your situation. In such cases we will then allow electronic submission until the restriction is lifted.
Best wishes, TH
