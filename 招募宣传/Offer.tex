Hi sophomore students, it's my honor to give you the recruitment letter to join the BB-CWL Project by \textsc{Hepta Workshop}. This project is associated with the \textsc{Information \& Technology Service}, which focuses on the transplant of some of BlackBoards's functionalities onto WeChat Applets. This recruitment letter also looks for candidate launchpad copartners for \textsc{Hepta Workshop}. Shown below are the positions and corresponding skills you need to command.


\begin{enumerate}



\item User Interface Designer (1 person): this is an \textbf{urgent} position, which means you're likely to be quickly accepted if you have corresponding skills. This position needs a relatively high level of aesthetical perception and design inspiration. If you join this position, you're going to design the user interface on our WeChat Applets. For example, you need to select from A and B, and tell why you think it's more aesthetically attracting. \\
